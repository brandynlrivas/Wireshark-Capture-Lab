📡 Wireshark Capture & Protocol Analysis Lab
📝 Overview

This project captures and analyzes live network traffic using Wireshark on macOS. The objective of this lab was to capture key network protocols and demonstrate effective packet-level analysis using Wireshark display filters. The lab focuses on understanding how common protocols operate in real-world network environments, particularly in modern networks that primarily enforce HTTPS encryption.

📦 Traffic Types Captured

The following traffic types were intentionally generated and successfully captured during the lab:

ICMP — Captured by issuing the ping google.com command to generate Echo Request and Echo Reply packets.

DNS — Captured by performing a domain name lookup using nslookup openai.com.

TCP 3-Way Handshake — Captured by initiating a fresh web connection to observe the SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packet exchange.

TCP Port 80 Traffic (HTTP-related) — Captured TCP packets directed to port 80 despite modern browsers automatically upgrading traffic to HTTPS.

1. ICMP (Ping Traffic)

ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply packets were captured and analyzed, confirming successful network connectivity between the client and destination host.

ICMP Traffic

2. DNS (Domain Name System Lookup)

DNS query and response packets were captured during the execution of the nslookup openai.com command. These packets demonstrate the process of resolving a domain name to one or more IP addresses.

3. TCP 3-Way Handshake

The TCP three-way handshake was captured during the setup of a new connection. The SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets were identified, confirming successful session establishment between the client and server.

4. TCP Port 80 Traffic (HTTP Attempt)

TCP packets directed to port 80 (the standard HTTP port) were captured. Although direct HTTP payloads were not visible due to HTTPS auto-upgrade enforcement, the TCP connection attempts themselves were still observable and analyzed.

5. Random Traffic Snapshot (Extra)

Additional background traffic was captured during the live session, including miscellaneous TCP and encrypted traffic generated by the operating system and running applications.

🧠 Skills Practiced

Packet capturing and saving

Applying Wireshark display filters

Analyzing ICMP, DNS, TCP handshakes, and HTTP-related traffic

Documenting findings with screenshots

Real-world troubleshooting in HTTPS-only environments

🛡 Notes

Due to modern network and browser security policies, direct HTTP traffic could not be captured in plaintext, as it was automatically upgraded to HTTPS. However, TCP traffic directed to port 80 was still captured and analyzed, demonstrating how transport-layer activity remains visible even when application-layer data is encrypted.

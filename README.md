# 📡 Wireshark Capture & Protocol Analysis Lab

## 📝 Overview
This project captures and analyzes **live network traffic** using **Wireshark on Windows 11**. The goal is to capture key network protocols and demonstrate packet-level analysis using Wireshark display filters in both secured (HTTPS) and unsecured (HTTP) environments.

## 🖥 Environment
- Operating System: Windows 11  
- Tool: Wireshark  
- Network: Active internet connection  
- Traffic Generation: Command Prompt and Web Browser  

## 📦 Traffic Types Captured
The following traffic types were intentionally generated and captured:
- **ICMP** — Captured via `ping google.com`
- **DNS** — Captured via `nslookup openai.com`
- **TCP 3-Way Handshake** — Captured by initiating a fresh web connection
- **HTTP Traffic (Port 80)** — Successfully captured in plaintext from an unsecured website

## 📸 Screenshots
### 1. ICMP (Ping Traffic)
Captured ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply packets, confirming basic network connectivity.

### 2. DNS (Domain Name System Lookup)
Captured DNS query and response packets during `nslookup openai.com`, demonstrating domain name resolution.

### 3. TCP 3-Way Handshake
Captured the SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK sequence during a new TCP connection setup, confirming successful session establishment.

### 4. HTTP Traffic (Unsecured Website)
Captured plaintext HTTP traffic from an unsecured website over TCP port 80. HTTP request and response headers, including GET requests, were visible and analyzed.

### 5. Random Traffic Snapshot (Extra)
Captured miscellaneous background traffic generated by the operating system and running applications during the live capture.

## 🔎 Creating Wireshark Filter Buttons
Wireshark allows frequently used display filters to be saved as filter buttons for quick access during analysis.

### Steps to Create a Filter Button
1. Enter a display filter in the filter bar (example: `icmp`).
2. Click the **“+” (Add Expression)** button to the right of the filter bar.
3. Select **Save this filter**.
4. Assign a label name (for example, `ICMP`).
5. Click **OK** to create the filter button.

### Example Filter Buttons Created
- **ICMP** — `icmp`  
- **DNS** — `dns`  
- **TCP Handshake** — `tcp.flags.syn == 1 || tcp.flags.ack == 1`  
- **HTTP (Port 80)** — `tcp.port == 80`  

These filter buttons allow rapid switching between protocol views without retyping display filters.

# 📡 Wireshark Capture & Protocol Analysis Lab

## 📝 Overview
This project captures and analyzes **live network traffic** using **Wireshark on macOS**.  
The goal is to capture key network protocols and demonstrate **packet-level analysis** using Wireshark display filters in a modern **HTTPS-dominant environment**.

---

## 📦 Traffic Types Captured

The following traffic types were intentionally generated and captured:

- **ICMP** — Captured via `ping google.com`
- **DNS** — Captured via `nslookup openai.com`
- **TCP 3-Way Handshake** — Captured by initiating a fresh web connection
- **TCP Port 80 Traffic (HTTP-related)** — Captured despite modern HTTPS enforcement

---

## 📸 Screenshots

### 1. ICMP (Ping Traffic)
Captured ICMP **Echo Request** and **Echo Reply** packets, confirming network connectivity.

### 2. DNS (Domain Name System Lookup)
Captured DNS **query** and **response** packets during `nslookup openai.com`, demonstrating domain name resolution.

**DNS Traffic**

### 3. TCP 3-Way Handshake
Captured the **SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK** sequence during a new TCP connection setup, confirming successful session establishment.

### 4. TCP Port 80 Traffic (HTTP Attempt)
Captured TCP packets directed to **port 80** (HTTP). Although direct HTTP payloads were not visible due to HTTPS auto-upgrade enforcement, the transport-layer activity was still observed and analyzed.

### 5. Random Traffic Snapshot (Extra)
Captured miscellaneous background traffic generated by the operating system and running applications during the live capture.
